Super Tic Tac Toe Game
Welcome to Super Tic Tac Toe Game, a web-based gaming application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

Overview
Super Tic Tac Toe Game is an extended version of the classic Tic Tac Toe. It introduces a strategic twist by nesting multiple Tic Tac Toe boards within each other, creating a challenging and engaging gameplay experience.

Features
Enhanced Game Grid: The game consists of a 3x3 grid, where each cell is another 3x3 Tic Tac Toe grid.

Strategic Gameplay: Players must win the smaller grids to claim cells in the larger grid. The choice of the cell determines the next player's move.

Dynamic Board: The board dynamically updates based on player moves, guiding the flow of the game.

How to Play
Start the Game: Open the game in your browser.

Make a Move: Each player takes turns placing their symbol (X or O) in an empty cell.

Claiming Cells: Winning a smaller grid allows a player to claim the corresponding cell in the larger grid.

Strategic Decisions: The cell where a player makes a move determines the smaller grid for the next player.

Winning the Game: The goal is to win three cells in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in the larger grid.

Continuous Play: The game continues until one player wins the larger grid or the entire board is filled, resulting in a draw.

Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
